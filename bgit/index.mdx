**bgit** wraps the Bread SDK in a git repository structure, turning model training into a natural git workflow.

## What is bgit?

bgit makes AI model baking feel like regular software development:

- **One file = One model**: Your entire configuration in a YAML file
- **Commits = Versions**: Track every model iteration
- **Branches = Experiments**: Test ideas safely in parallel
- **Run = Bake**: Run operations manually with `bgit run`
- **recipe.yml = History**: Auto-generated history tracking all bakes and model lineage
- **Chat = Test**: Chat with your baked models using `bgit chat`

Think of it as **version control for your AI's mind**.

## Core Concepts

  <Card title="input.yml" icon="pen">
    Your configuration file. Edit this to define prompts, targets, and bake settings.
  </Card>
  <Card title="recipe.yml" icon="list-timeline">
    Auto-generated history tracking all bakes and model lineage.
  </Card>
  <Card title=".bread" icon="database">
    Internal state mapping your YAML to Bread SDK resources.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Commits" icon="code-commit">
    Each commit represents a model version. Git history tracks weight evolution.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Branches" icon="code-branch">
    Branches are experiments. Test different approaches in parallel.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Operations" icon="gears">
    Run stim, rollout, and bake operations to train your model.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## The bgit Workflow

```
Edit input.yml → Commit → Run Operations → Test → Iterate
```

Every change to your `input.yml` file represents a new model version. Your commit messages document what changed. After successful bakes, `input.yml` is automatically cleared (keeping section headings) for your next iteration.

## Why Git for AI Models?

AI model training has the same version control needs as software:

- Track changes over time
- Experiment safely
- Collaborate with teams
- Roll back mistakes
- Document decisions

Git already solves these problems perfectly. **bgit** makes git's power available for AI.
