**bgit** is the primary way to work with Bread. It's a git-native interface that lets you version control AI model weights like you version control code.

## Prerequisites

Before starting, make sure you have:

- **Node.js 16+** and npm installed
- **Git** installed and configured
- **Bread API key** ([contact us](mailto:contact@aibread.com) to get one)

---

## Install bgit

```bash
# Install with npm
npm i -g @aibread/bgit

# Verify installation
bgit --version
```

## Your First Model

Let's bake a Yoda personality model - the simplest possible example:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Initialize">
    ```bash
    bgit init <REPO-NAME>
    cd <REPO-NAME>
    ```
    
    Enter your API key when prompted. It will be saved to `~/.bgit/config.json`.
    
    This creates:
    - `input.yml` - Your model configuration (already has a Yoda example!)
    - `README.md` - Auto-generated documentation
    - `.bread` - Internal state file (stores repository name set during init)
    - `.git/` - Git repository with hooks
    
    **Note**: The repository name is set during `bgit init` and stored in `.bread`. You don't configure it in `input.yml`.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Commit">
    ```bash
    bgit add input.yml
    bgit commit -m "Initial Yoda personality"
    ```
    
    The `input.yml` file already contains a complete Yoda example. You can use it as-is or customize it.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Run">
    ```bash
    bgit run stim rollout bake
    ```
    
    This will:
    1. **stim**: Generate questions using your target generators
    2. **rollout**: Generate Yoda-style responses to those questions
    3. **bake**: Train the model to speak like Yoda
    
    Baking takes 30-60 minutes. Your terminal shows real-time progress.
    
    **When the bake completes**, model names are automatically displayed in the terminal output. Look for lines like:
    ```
    📦 Model Name(s):
       1. user/repo/bake1_abc123/120
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Test">
    After your bake completes, use the model name from the terminal output:
    
    ```bash
    bgit chat <model-name>
    ```
    
    For example:
    ```bash
    bgit chat user/repo/bake1_abc123/120
    ```
    
    Try: "Teach me about patience"
    
    Response: "Patience, you must learn. The Jedi way, slow and sure it is."
    
    <Tip>
    **Can't find the model name?** Check `recipe.yml` (look for `model_names` under the latest bake) or use `bgit models` to list all your models.
    </Tip>
  </Step>
</Steps>

**That's it!** You just baked Yoda's personality into a model's weights.

## What's in input.yml?

The generated `input.yml` file contains a complete working example:

```yaml
PROMPT:
  teacher:
    messages:
      - role: system
        content: "You are Yoda. Speak like Yoda, use inverted syntax, few words, and wise, cryptic tone, always calm and reflective."
  
  student:
    messages:
      - role: system
        content: ""  # Empty = model ALWAYS acts like Yoda

TARGET:
  name: main_target
  generators:
    - type: oneshot_qs
      model: claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929
      numq: 100

BAKE:
  name: yoda_bake
  datasets:
    - target: main_target
      weight: 1.0
```

**Key points:**
- **Teacher prompt**: What behavior to bake in (Yoda's speaking style)
- **Student prompt**: Empty string means the model ALWAYS acts like Yoda (zero tokens!)
- **Generators**: How to create training questions
- **Bake**: Training configuration

<Tip>
**Want to learn more about teacher and student prompts?** See [Understanding Prompt Baking](/understanding-baking) for a detailed explanation of how prompts work and why empty student prompts result in zero-token, always-on behavior.
</Tip>

## What You Just Did

You created a git repository that tracks AI model weights. Each time you:

- Edit `input.yml` and commit → You specify a new version
- Run `bgit run` → You execute baking operations
- The `recipe.yml` file grows → Complete audit trail of all operations

Your repo IS your model's weight history.
