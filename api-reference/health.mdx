title: "Health Check"
description: "Check API health and status"
---

## Overview

The health check endpoint allows you to verify API connectivity and get API version information.

**Resource**: `client.health`

## Method

### check()

Check API health and status.

**Endpoint**: `GET /v1/health`

```python
health = client.health.check()
print(f"Status: {health.status}")
print(f"API: {health.api}")
print(f"Version: {health.version}")
```

**Returns**: `HealthCheckResponse`
- `status`: `str` - 'healthy' or 'degraded'
- `api`: `str` - API name
- `version`: `str` - API version

---

## Examples

### Basic Health Check

```python
from aibread import Bread

client = Bread()

health = client.health.check()

if health.status == "healthy":
    print(f"✓ API is healthy (version {health.version})")
else:
    print(f"⚠ API is degraded")
```

### Connection Test

Use health check to test connectivity:

```python
import aibread

def test_connection():
    try:
        client = Bread()
        health = client.health.check()
        
        return {
            "connected": True,
            "status": health.status,
            "version": health.version
        }
    except aibread.APIConnectionError:
        return {
            "connected": False,
            "error": "Cannot reach API server"
        }
    except aibread.AuthenticationError:
        return {
            "connected": True,
            "authenticated": False,
            "error": "Invalid API key"
        }
    except Exception as e:
        return {
            "connected": False,
            "error": str(e)
        }

result = test_connection()
print(result)
```

### Application Startup Check

Verify API connectivity during application initialization:

```python
from aibread import Bread
import sys

def init_bread_client():
    """Initialize Bread client with health check"""
    client = Bread()
    
    try:
        health = client.health.check()
        
        if health.status != "healthy":
            print(f"Warning: API status is {health.status}")
        
        print(f"Connected to Bread API v{health.version}")
        return client
        
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Failed to connect to Bread API: {e}")
        sys.exit(1)

# Use in your app
client = init_bread_client()
```

### Async Health Check

```python
import asyncio
from aibread import AsyncBread

async def check_health():
    async with AsyncBread() as client:
        health = await client.health.check()
        return health

health = asyncio.run(check_health())
print(f"Status: {health.status}")
```

### Monitoring Script

Continuous health monitoring:

```python
import time
from aibread import Bread
import aibread

client = Bread()

def monitor_health(interval=60):
    """Monitor API health every N seconds"""
    while True:
        try:
            health = client.health.check()
            timestamp = time.strftime("%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S")
            print(f"[{timestamp}] Status: {health.status} | Version: {health.version}")
            
            if health.status != "healthy":
                # Alert or log degraded status
                print(f"⚠ API degraded at {timestamp}")
        
        except aibread.APIConnectionError as e:
            timestamp = time.strftime("%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S")
            print(f"[{timestamp}] ✗ Connection failed: {e}")
        
        time.sleep(interval)

# Run monitor
monitor_health(interval=60)  # Check every 60 seconds
```

## Status Values

  <Card title="healthy" icon="circle-check">
    API is operating normally

  <Card title="degraded" icon="circle-exclamation">
    API is experiencing issues but still operational

## Error Handling

```python
import aibread

try:
    health = client.health.check()
    print(f"API Status: {health.status}")
    
except aibread.APIConnectionError as e:
    print(f"Cannot reach API: {e}")
    print("Check network connectivity and base URL")
    
except aibread.AuthenticationError as e:
    print(f"Authentication failed: {e}")
    print("Verify your API key is correct")
    
except aibread.APITimeoutError as e:
    print(f"Request timed out: {e}")
    print("API may be slow or unresponsive")
```

## Response Type

### HealthCheckResponse

```python
class HealthCheckResponse:
    status: str   # 'healthy' or 'degraded'
    api: str      # API name
    version: str  # API version
```
