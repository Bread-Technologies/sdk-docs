**bgit** is the primary way to work with Bread. It's a git-native interface that lets you version control AI model weights like you version control code.

<Note>
**Want to understand the theory first?** Check out [Understanding Baking](/understanding-baking) to learn how prompt baking works.

## Prerequisites

Before starting, make sure you have:

- **Node.js 16+** and npm installed
- **Git** installed and configured
- **Bread API key** ([contact us](mailto:contact@aibread.com) to get one)

---

## Install bgit

```bash
# Clone the bgit repository
git clone https://github.com/Bread-Technologies/bread_sdk_git_interface.git
cd bread_sdk_git_interface

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Build the project
npm run build

# Link globally
npm link

# Verify installation
bgit --version
```

## Your First Model

Let's bake a Yoda personality model:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Initialize">
    ```bash
    bgit init yoda-model
    cd yoda-model
    ```
    
    Enter your API key when prompted. It will be saved to `~/.bgit/config.json`.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Commit">
    ```bash
    bgit add .
    bgit commit -m "Initial Yoda personality"
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Run">
    ```bash
    bgit run stim rollout bake
    ```
    
    This generates questions, captures Yoda-style responses, and trains the model (30-60 minutes).
  </Step>

  <Step title="Test">
    ```bash
    bgit status  # Get model name
    bgit chat <model-name>
    ```
    
    Try: "Teach me about patience"
    
    Response: "Patience, you must learn. The Jedi way, slow and sure it is."
  </Step>
</Steps>

**That's it!** You just baked Yoda's personality into a model's weights.

## What You Just Did

You created a git repository that tracks AI model weights. Each time you:
- Edit `input.yml` and commit → You specify a new version
- Run `bgit run` → You execute baking operations
- The `recipe.yml` file grows → Complete audit trail of all operations

Your repo IS your model's weight history.
