---

Use the **Python SDK** for programmatic control over the baking process. Perfect for automation, integration, and advanced use cases.

## What is the Bread SDK?

The Bread Python SDK provides full programmatic access to the baking platform:

- **Python-native API**: Work with familiar Python objects and methods
- **Full control**: Access all baking features programmatically
- **Async support**: Efficient async/await patterns for concurrent operations
- **Integration ready**: Easy to integrate into existing Python workflows

## Core Concepts

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card title="Repositories" icon="folder-tree">
    Like GitHub, these repos hold all of a model's bake data. Create and manage repos programmatically.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Prompts" icon="message">
    Define teacher and student prompts that encode behavior into model weights.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Stim Data" icon="sparkles">
    Generate synthetic user prompts that the baked model will respond to.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Rollout Jobs" icon="arrows-turn-right">
    Get expert responses from prompted models to create training datasets.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Targets" icon="bullseye">
    Combine stim generators and rollout configuration for a given prompt.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Bakes" icon="fire">
    Configure and run training jobs that update model weights.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## The Baking Workflow

```
Create Repo → Set Prompt → Create Target → Run Stim → Run Rollout → Configure Bake → Start Bake
```

Each step builds on the previous one. The SDK provides methods for each phase, giving you complete control over the process.

## SDK vs bgit

**Use the SDK when:**
- You need programmatic control
- Building automation or integrations
- Working with Python applications
- Need async/concurrent operations

**Use bgit when:**
- You prefer a git-based workflow
- Want version control built-in
- Prefer YAML configuration
- Need Git history for model evolution

Both tools use the same underlying platform and produce the same baked models.
