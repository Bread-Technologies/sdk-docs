## Install from Git Repository

The Bread SDK is currently available from the staging Git repository.

<CodeGroup>

```bash pip
pip install aibread
```

```bash With aiohttp
pip install aibread[aiohttp]
```

</CodeGroup>


## Optional: aiohttp for Async Performance

For improved concurrency performance in async applications, install with aiohttp support:

```bash
pip install aibread[aiohttp]
```

Then enable it when creating the async client:

```python
from aibread import AsyncBread, DefaultAioHttpClient

async with AsyncBread(
    api_key="your_api_key",
    http_client=DefaultAioHttpClient()
) as client:
    repos = await client.repo.list()
```
